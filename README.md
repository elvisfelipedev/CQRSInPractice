# CQRS in Practice with .NET Core

This is a sample project to showcase CQRS in practice. I used this to present CQRS at San Diego .NET group, in San Diego - California.

# Disclaimer:

  - Project was not built using any architectural design.
  - There are some known frameworks to implement CQRS, such as MediatR, however, focus of this code is to understand in depth how CQRS principles apply instead of just calling abstracted methods on whatever framework you use.
