# CQRS in Practice with .NET Core / CQRS Fundamentals and Implementation

This is a sample project to showcase CQRS in practice. I used this to present CQRS at San Diego .NET group, in San Diego - California and updated for Visual Studio Summit 2019 in Sao Paulo

# Disclaimer:

  - Project was not built using any architectural design.
  - There are some known frameworks to implement CQRS, such as MediatR, however, focus of this code is to understand in depth how CQRS principles apply instead of just calling abstracted methods on whatever framework you use.
